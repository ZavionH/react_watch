        <h2>Watches VS Timepieces</h2>
        <p>Watches typically have a battery that keeps it running. These batteries are quartz and are what make them tick-tock
           at a slower rate than a movement.  Youâ€™ll see the hands of the watch move in second-by-second strokes instead of a
           smooth sweeping motion. Timepieces have either mechanical wind movements or automatic wind movements. 
           Some pieces have both. These movements are composed of many wheels, springs, gears, and tiny pieces that keep the 
           timepiece running impeccably even under some of the harshest and most extreme conditions. There are watches that use 
           movements as well.  What separates them from the other timepieces is that the movement is typically outsourced and made
           by a mass producer.  Some examples are ETA movements and Japanese movements. These are better than the battery but not 
           as prestigious as a COSC certified movement.</p>
